A DialogueManager must be present in the scene.


To create an interactable object with dialgoue:

* create an object, likely a sprite
* the object must have the following scripts
--- Collider 2D     -> set isTrigger to TRUE, aka check it off
--- DialogueTrigger, this is where you write the dialogue, it communicates with the dialogue manager
--- Interactable -> drag your dialoguetrigger into the DT field
